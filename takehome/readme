INSTRUCTIONS FOR TAKE HOME ASSIGNMENT

Part 1: 
Use tcpdump to capture HTTP web traffic. To test this, after running tcpdump with the appropriate flags, you can run curl -I google.com in a separate window and should see an output in your tcpdump window.

Part 2:
In this directory we have the flag.pcapng from the tryhackme room we did a while back. 
Instead of using wireshark or an online tool, we already know that it is hiding flag.txt in the http traffic. Use the -r flag for tcpdump to read the contents of flag.pcapng and apply a filter to show only http traffic to find flag.txt
